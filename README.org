- `geckodriver`
- `ascii-image-converter`
** Installation
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       9b8d8950-64d3-4e33-9158-8ce870c1d9f1
:END:
- Install `geckodriver`: `sudo apt install geckodriver`
- Install `ascii-image-converter`: `sudo apt install ascii-image-converter`
- Clone this repo and `cargo install --path .`
- In Emacs, `M-x load-file` and then load `muse.el` in this repo
- `M-x muse-search` and add the query, then press `d` on a video listed in the resulting buffer to download the audio track, `v` to view the video and its related videos in another buffer, `o` to open the video link in the system browser.
** Notes

:END:
The `muse` cli does not manage the `geckodriver server`, that is responsibility of `muse-mode`. If you want to use the cli independently, start a geckodriver server with `geckodriver --port=4444`.

:END:
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully
- [ ] Allow the cli help to be printed without a `geckodriver` server
- [ ] Add `Muse` implementations for other sources (Spotify, etc)
- [ ] Add 'preview' under `p`, slicing with https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/388148
  - [ ] Would be good to be able to see the video length
- [ ] Stream video to terminal as ascii art under `w` (watch), on the view page
- [ ] Add a more sophisticated `transient` menu to control the download options
  - [ ] Have a `magit` style `transient` menu on `muse-mode` buffers
- [ ] Add a command to go to the channel for a video, bound to `c`
- [ ] Add tests
